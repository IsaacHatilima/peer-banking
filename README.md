# **React Inertia Laravel Tailwind (RILT) Multi-Tenancy Starter Kit**

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repo-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/IsaacHatilima/multi-tenancy)

## 🚀 Project Status: **Active Maintenance**

## 📌 About the Project

This starter kit streamlines the development of multi-tenant web applications using **Laravel, React, Inertia.js, and
Tailwind CSS**. It provides **authentication and multi-tenancy out of the box**, leveraging the **Tenancy for Laravel**
package with a **PostgreSQL multi-schema setup** for tenant database isolation.

### ✨ **Key Features**

✅ **Multi-Tenancy (PostgreSQL Multi-Schema Setup)** – Each tenant has its own isolated database schema for enhanced
security and scalability.  
✅ **Authentication Included** – Pre-configured authentication system for tenants.  
✅ **Actions-Based Architecture** – Business logic is encapsulated in action classes, ensuring clean and maintainable
controllers.  
✅ **Full-Stack SPA Experience** – Powered by **React & Inertia.js** for smooth, client-server interactions.  
✅ **Modern UI** – Styled with **Tailwind CSS & Mantine UI** for fast and responsive UI development.  
✅ **Scalable & Extensible** – Easily add new features without breaking core functionality.

## 🏗 **Architecture Decisions**

### 📌 **Actions-Based Controllers**

All business logic is encapsulated in **action classes**, ensuring clean, single-responsibility controllers.

### 📌 **Inertia.js + React for a Full-Stack SPA**

Combines Laravel's power with React's reactivity while keeping server-side routing and controller integration intuitive.

### 📌 **Tailwind + Mantine UI for Rapid UI Development**

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach for easy customization.
- **Mantine UI**: Pre-styled, accessible React components for seamless UI design.

### 📌 **Multi-Tenancy with PostgreSQL Multi-Schema**

This project uses **PostgreSQL's multi-schema** capability to isolate tenant data while maintaining a single database
instance. The **Tenancy for Laravel** package:

- Automatically switches to the correct tenant schema based on the domain (e.g., `ten1.app.com`).
- Prevents unauthorized tenant access using middleware.
- Simplifies data management and backups while maintaining strong isolation.

## 📌 **Next Steps & Future Enhancements**

🔹 Improve documentation with screenshots and a demo link.  
🔹 Add testing strategies to ensure tenant isolation works as expected.  
🔹 Consider adding optional API support for tenant-based API access.
